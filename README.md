# Reading_frame_essentials

Short description

Reading_frame_essentials contains code with functions used for determining aminoacids, corresponding basepairs from DNA sequences. The effect of these two in relation to indels and fusion proteins can also be determined.

# Description Acseq (see markdown file)
The function Acseq generates a dictionary with keys as amino acids and values as codon triplets in three reading frames from input DNA sequences. Please use DNA sequences with lowercase "a", "c", "t" or "g". Other inputs will give a ValueError.

Functions determining the effect of point mutations and fusion proteins will be deposited in the future.
